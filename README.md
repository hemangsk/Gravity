If there's any issue you are facing in setting up this theme I'm there for you. Just create an issue in this repository (<http://github.com/hemangsk/Gravity>), (<https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/>) and I'll get back to you asap.

![Welcome to Gravity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13018570/27043040-778d80cc-4fb6-11e7-8619-de4be626be67.png)

# INSTALLATION

### Dependencies

Gravity uses Jekyll and it's built-in SCSS compiler for the associated CSS, so the first thing you'll need is Jekyll itself:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll
```

In case you don't have the `bundler` gem installed already, you can install it as follows:

```bash
$ gem install bundler
```

For pagination, Gravity uses the [jekyll-paginate](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/) gem :

```bash
$ gem install jekyll-paginate
```

***

# USAGE

Once you have the required gems, you can go ahead and clone the
[Gravity repository](https://github.com/hemangsk/Gravity) or [download](https://github.com/hemangsk/Gravity/archive/master.zip)
a zip of the master branch.

Run :

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

Jekyll should now be generating your content!

# ADDING POSTS

The theme by default ships with starter posts located in `_posts/`. Delete these posts and add your content to the `_posts`
folder to see them being served up by Jekyll. [This](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) would be a good guide to getting started on writing posts using Jekyll. We've added a concise guide below:

- Create a .markdown file inside `_posts` folder.
- Name the file according to the format YY-MM-DD-[short name for your post].
- `2016-03-30-i-love-design.markdown`
- Write the *Front Matter* and content in the file.

### FORMAT

```
---
layout: post | default | page
title: String POST TITLE
date: Time Stamp
categories: String | Array of Strings CATEGORY / CATEGORIES
---

---
layout: post
