This is my first post on the sports page! Today there are some intriguing storylines; first we look over to Eurpope where France and Germany play to decide who will face Christiano Ronaldo and Portugal in the Finals of EURO 2016. While the host nation France hope to keep their tradition alive of raisng trophies on their home soil, Germany is in a familiar role as the super power poised to knock-off yet another host nation as they did previously in the Brazil World Cup. The reigning world champions vs. the entire nation of France, there is a lot of history here and no love lost on the field. 90 minutes will decide who will be remembered and who will end their campaign for glory one step short of the penultimate goal.
