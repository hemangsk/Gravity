The topic was brought up in yet another weired <s><i>R-rated</i></s> converstation with the Procrastination Queen. I was telling the story of how embarrassing it was to study and discuss poems that have a sexual connotation. Our teacher once asked a classmate to explain, the poor girl was really embarrassed and said "....eh...and she wants to have sex with..." and then the teacher was like "oh so now you all say have sex? Why not use make love, isn't make love sounds more romantic". And to illustrate with an example, I chose a poem written by **Emily Dickinson**:

>In Winter in my Room
>
>I came upon a Worm --
>
>Pink, lank and warm --
>
>But as he was a worm
>
> -- excerpt from the first stanza from "In Winter in my Room" by Emily Dickinson

Oh boy, if you're thinking what I'm thinking...... But that is not all, yet. In a later stanza:

>He fathomed me --
>
>Then to a Rhythm Slim
>
>Secreted in his Form
>
>As Patterns swim
>
>Projected him.

In case that you were thinking of nothing while reading the first stanza, the verb "fathom" (~to measure) pretty much speaks for it all. If you're still not getting it, never mind, and carry on with your innocent life.
