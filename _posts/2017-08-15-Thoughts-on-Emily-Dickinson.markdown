The topic was brought up in yet another weired <s><i>R-rated</i></s> converstation with the Procrastination Queen (PQ). I was telling the story of how embarrassing it was to study and discuss poems that have a sexual connotation. Our teacher once asked a classmate to explain, the poor girl was really embarrassed and said "....eh...and she wants to have sex with..." and then the teacher was like "oh so now you all say have sex? Why not use make love, isn't make love sounds more romantic". And to illustrate with an example, I chose a poem written by **Emily Dickinson**:

>In Winter in my Room
>
>I came upon a Worm --
>
>Pink, lank and warm --
>
>But as he was a worm
>
> -- *excerpt from the first stanza from "In Winter in my Room" by Emily Dickinson*

Oh boy, if you're thinking what I'm thinking...... But that is not all, yet. In a later stanza:

>He fathomed me --
>
>Then to a Rhythm Slim
>
>Secreted in his Form
>
>As Patterns swim
>
>Projected him.

In case that you were thinking of nothing while reading the first stanza, the verb "fathom" (~to measure) pretty much speaks for it all. If you're still not getting it, never mind, carry on with your innocent life.

You must all have the same question in mind as PQ, "what's the point of learning a poem like this (filled with sexual innuendo)?". Well, it just happened to be in the *Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson*. Read it. And you will understand why Emily Dickinson stands out from all English speaking poets + french poets + chinese poets and win my heart as my favourite poet of all time. **She writes accross all kinds of themes, and each and every of them is so insightful in content, intense in emotion, intelligent in wording.** Let's see some examples.

Life philosophy in general:

>Success is counted sweetest
>
>By those who ne'er succeed.
>
>To comprehend a nectar
>
>Requires sorest need.
>
>-- *First stanza of "Success is counted sweetest".*
I think there is a point in our life that we all realised that, yes, everything works on a relative scale - if there is no bitterness, we wouldn't qualify anything as sweet. Yet, every time I read these lines, I am amazed how it's so beautifully written down by Dickinson.

And my favourite of all - *"We never know how high we are".
>We never know how high we are  
>  Till we are called to rise;  
>And then, if we are true to plan,  
>  Our statures touch the skies—  
>   
>The Heroism we recite
>  Would be a daily thing,  
>Did not ourselves the Cubits warp  
>  For fear to be a King—
