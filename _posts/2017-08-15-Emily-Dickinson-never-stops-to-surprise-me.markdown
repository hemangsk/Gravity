The topic was brought up in yet another weired <s><i>R-rated</i></s> converstation with my friend - the Procrastination Queen (PQ). I was telling the story of how embarrassing it was to study and discuss poems that have a sexual connotation. Our teacher once asked a classmate to explain, the poor girl was really embarrassed and said "....eh...and she wants to have sex with..." and then the teacher was like "oh so now you all say have sex? Why not use make love, isn't make love sounds more romantic". And to illustrate with an example, I chose a poem written by **Emily Dickinson**:

>In Winter in my Room
>
>I came upon a Worm --
>
>Pink, lank and warm --
>
>But as he was a worm
>
> -- *excerpt from the first stanza from "In Winter in my Room" by Emily Dickinson*

Oh boy, if you're thinking what I'm thinking...... But that is not all, yet. In a later stanza:

>He fathomed me --
>
>Then to a Rhythm Slim
>
>Secreted in his Form
>
>As Patterns swim
>
>Projected him.

In case that you were thinking of nothing while reading the first stanza, the verb "fathom" (~to measure) pretty much speaks for it all. If you're still not getting it, never mind, carry on with your innocent life.

You must all have the same question in mind as PQ, "what's the point of learning a poem like this (filled with sexual innuendo)?". Well, it just happened to be in the *Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson*. Read it. And you will understand why Emily Dickinson stands out from all English speaking poets + french poets + chinese poets and win my heart as my favourite poet of all time. **She writes accross all kinds of themes, and each and every of them is so insightful in content, intense in emotion, intelligent in wording.** Let's see some examples.

Life philosophy in general:

>Success is counted sweetest
>
>By those who ne'er succeed.
>
>To comprehend a nectar
>
>Requires sorest need.
>
>-- *First stanza of "Success is counted sweetest".*

I think there is a point in our life that we all realise that, yes, everything works on a relative scale - if there is no bitterness, we couldn't qualify anything as sweet. Yet, every time I read these lines, I am amazed how it's so beautifully written down by Dickinson.

On Fame:

>I’m Nobody! Who are you?
>
>Are you – Nobody – too?
>
>Then there’s a pair of us!
>
>Don’t tell! they’d advertise – you know!
>
>How dreary – to be – Somebody!
>
>How public – like a Frog –  
>
>To tell one’s name – the livelong June –  
>
>To an admiring Bog!

On Love and Death:

>I could not die with you,	
>
>For one must wait	
>
>To shut the other’s gaze down,—
>
>You could not.	
>
>And I, could I stand by	
>
>And see you freeze,	
>
>Without my right of frost,	
>
>Death’s privilege?
>
> -- excerpt from *"I cannot live with you."*

And my favourite of all, a poem that would make you feel like reading a shonen manga - *"We never know how high we are".* FYI "Cubit" is a small unit of length.

>We never know how high we are  
>
>  Till we are called to rise;  
>
>And then, if we are true to plan,  
>
>  Our statures touch the skies—  
>
>The Heroism we recite
>
>  Would be a daily thing,  
>
>Did not ourselves the Cubits warp  
>
>  For fear to be a King—

And of course, she wrote about much more things and topics, but since "Emily Dickinson 101" is not the focus of this article, let's jump to the conclusion: Emily Dickinson is one of the greatest american poet of all time. (Insert a useless backstory: Emily's father had little idea about his gifted daughter. He used to tell the guests that his son Austin writes like Shakespeare, unaware of the fact that the greatest american poet resided upstairs.)

**But as I am too aware of her poetic talent, what could possibly surprise me again?** Well...I had little interest in her personal life, untill today when I was Googling these poems for PQ, I bumped into Emily's correspondence with her dear friend, slash, sister-in-law, Susan. And yes, theese letters make me question her sexuality, the later could shine new light on some poems. Without further ado, here's some quotes from her letter to her "friend" ;) .

Passage 1
>I have but one thought, Susie, this afternoon of June, and that of you, and I have one prayer, only; dear Susie, that is for you. That you and I in hand as we e’en do in heart, \[...\] Susie, and when I look around me and find myself alone, I sigh for you again; little sigh, and vain sigh, which will not bring you home.
