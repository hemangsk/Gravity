<h2>About Me</h2>

  <strong>Biography</strong>
  </div>
<p>  <div class="manual-content">

<p>I am a physics graduate from Imperial College London. I originally come from Beijing, China. And I lived in southern France for 7 years. I can speak Chinese, English and French fluently, entiendo un poco español. I am currently trying to learn German! </p>
<br>
<p>My projects are mostly computational, involving either simulation or data analysis <small>(Maybe I should call myself a theoretist?)</small> I used to be a python fan but right now I favor R slightly more. <s>Matlab is okay</s>.</p>

  <strong>Interest</strong>
  </div>
<p>  <div class="manual-content">
<p>I want to improve undergraduate teaching of physics. Does there exist a way to pass on the great knowledge without intentionally perplex student and the use of dark magic <i>"it's trivial"</i> ??</p>
<br>
<p>Academically, I am interested in statistical inference, network and complex systems.</p>
